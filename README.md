Project to show case my skills. I have worked on may projects but unfortunately I signed non-disclosure agreements. However, over time I will update this project, that way anyone wishing to test my ability to develop may see me here in action.

## The Project

I will develop a system to recieve data from a device sending data through TCP and storing the data in the database. The databases will be both relational and unrelational databases.
